## Supply Chain Diagnostic Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs a **diagnostic analysis of a supply chain dataset** to identify inefficiencies related to products, suppliers, logistics, inventory management, and quality control. The analysis aims to understand **why performance issues occur** and to provide actionable, data-driven business insights.
The project combines **SQL for data analysis** and **Power BI for interactive dashboards**, making it suitable for business stakeholders and decision-makers.
 🎯 Objectives
- Identify high-revenue products with stock availability issues
- Analyze supplier performance based on lead time, cost, and defect rates
- Evaluate logistics efficiency across transportation modes and routes
- Detect demand and inventory mismatches
- Support data-driven supply chain optimization
 ## 🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following domains:
- Product details (Product Type, SKU, Price, Availability)
- Sales and Revenue metrics
- Inventory and Order quantities
- Supplier and Manufacturing information
- Shipping modes, routes, and costs
- Quality inspection results and defect rates
**Data Source:** Internal supply chain database  
**Database:** MySQL  
 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data extraction and diagnostic analysis
- **Power BI** – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **DAX** – KPI calculations and measures
- **OBS Studio** – Dashboard recording
- **Gamma AI** – Report generation
## 📊 Key Analyses Performed (SQL)
- Products generating high revenue with low stock availability
- High-selling SKUs with frequent stock-outs
- Suppliers with high manufacturing lead time
- Relationship between manufacturing cost and defect rates
- Product categories with high defect rates
- Transportation modes with higher cost and quality risks
- Inventory demand vs stock level mismatches
## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI report consists of three main sections:
1. **Overview Dashboard** – High-level KPIs and revenue insights
2. **Product Insight Dashboard** – Product demand, inventory, and profitability analysis
3. **Supplier Insight Dashboard** – Supplier performance and logistics evaluation

The dashboard provides interactive filters for product type, SKU, supplier name, and transportation mode.
 🔍 Key Findings
- Revenue is concentrated in a limited number of SKUs and product types
- Several products face demand exceeding available stock
- Certain suppliers show higher lead times and defect rates
- Logistics costs vary significantly across transportation modes

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Improve demand forecasting for high-selling products
- Optimize inventory levels to prevent stock-outs
- Re-evaluate underperforming suppliers
- Optimize transportation mode selection to reduce cost and defects
- Strengthen quality inspection processes
